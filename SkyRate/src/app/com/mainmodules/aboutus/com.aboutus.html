                            Given the complexities involved in the purchase and repair of Aircraft Parts;
                            AviationRating.com was formed to provide its members with real-world vendor ratings and
                            reviews from actual everyday customers who provide their experience and feedback for the
                            vendors which are represented on this site. These ratings and reviews are meant to assist
                            you the customer, providing you the ability in advance to have a more accurate picture of
                            the type of company you might potentially be conducting business with; their strengths,
                            weakness….etc., without going through the costly route of purchasing a part or sending a
                            part in for repair having had zero advanced visibility only to find out that the vendor has
                            terrible customer service or cannot meet their promised TAT or did not honor their quoted
                            price. Our goal is to make it easier for all customers within the aviation sector to share
                            and provide each other with the necessary critical information to draw upon others actual
                            experiences in order to make a completely informed decision on who will earn your aviation
                            business. <br>
                            <br />
                            Since there are always two sides to every situation companies, you have the ability to

                            <br />
                            All ratings are based on actual reviews by other members and are not in anyway influenced
                            by AviationRating.com or it’s staff. What you see are the real experiences your colleagues
                            in the industry have experienced, complaints or complements. <br>
                            <br />We ask that you join this community and share your experience. When giving a rating
                            or review please provide a professional opinion, provide information that you would like to
                            see when making a decision. Keep in mind that what you are saying is potentially helping
                            someone in our industry make the correct decision and avoid the wrong decision.<br>
                            <br />All too often many of us only take the time to provide negative feedback. We ask that
                            you please take a moment to also provide positive feedback. When a vendor does it the right
                            way and provides you with the service you wanted let others know so that others will go to
                            that vendor.
                            <br>
                            <br />Thank you for being a part of this community and with the involvement of both sides

                            our industry to make the best decision as a customer and improve our services as a vendor.
