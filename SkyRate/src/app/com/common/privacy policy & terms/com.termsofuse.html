                                    AviationRating with respect to the Site. If any provision of
                                    these Terms of Use is found to be unenforceable or invalid,
                                    that provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum
                                    extent necessary so that these Terms of Use will otherwise
                                    remain in full force and effect and enforceable. The failure of

                                    for any waiver of compliance with these Terms of Use to be
                                    binding, AviationRating must provide you with written notice of
                                    such waiver through one of its authorized representatives.</div><br />
